This is the first side project that I have done at Tech Elevator. This project was to help enforce the programming basics that we have learned in the first two weeks. In this program you are allowed to study random questions from two sets. The side displayed is a question and after you answer it, you can press enter to flip the card for the actual answer. You can continue to do this until you are done or want to swap sets.
